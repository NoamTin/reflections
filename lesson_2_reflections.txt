What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git metadata file is made, but no commits are made. This is needed so that all commits will now be recorded.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows for grouping files in the working directory for commiting to the repository. Unlike the others, it allows for logical grouping.
